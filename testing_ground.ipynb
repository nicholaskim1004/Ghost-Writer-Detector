golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago\\nSome people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow\\nSome people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem\\nI was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin\\' to make a vow soon\\nThat I\\'ma get fucked up, fillin\\' up my cup, I see the crowd mood\\nChangin\\' by the minute and the record on repeat\\nTook a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me\\n\\n[Chorus]\\n\"Nigga, why you babysittin\\' only two or three shots?\\nI\\'ma show you how to turn it up a notch\\nFirst, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it\\nPool full of liquor, then you dive in it\\nI wave a few bottles, then I watch \\'em all flock\\nAll the girls wanna play Baywatch\\nI got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it\\nPo-pool full of liquor, I\\'ma dive in it\"\\n\\n[Refrain]\\nPour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)\\nSit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)\\nPass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)\\nFaded (Drank), faded (Drank)\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nOkay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick\\nI am your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick\\nI know that you\\'re nauseous right now \\nand I\\'m hopin\\' to lead you to victory, Kendrick\\nIf I take another one down, I\\'ma drown in some poison, abusin\\' my limit\\nI think that I\\'m feelin\\' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes\\nI see the feelin\\', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived\\nThis how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I\\'m over-influenced\\nBy what you are doin\\', I thought I was doin\\' the most \\'til someone said to me\\n\\n[Chorus]\\n\"Nigga, why you babysittin\\' only two or three shots?\\nI\\'ma show you how to turn it up a notch\\nFirst, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it\\nPool full of liquor, then you dive in it\\nI wave a few bottles, then I watch \\'em all flock\\nAll the girls wanna play Baywatch\\nI got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it\\nPo-pool full of liquor, I\\'ma dive in it\"\\n\\n[Refrain]\\nPour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)\\nSit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)\\nPass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)\\nFaded (Drank), faded (Drank)\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nI ride, you ride, bang\\nOne chopper, one hundred shots, bang\\nHop out, do you bang?\\nTwo chopper, two hundred shots, bang\\nI ride, you ride, bang\\nOne chopper, one hundred shots, bang\\nHop out, do you bang?\\nTwo chopper, two hundred shots, bang\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nNigga, why you babysittin\\' only two or three shots?\\nI\\'ma show you how to turn it up a notch\\nFirst, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it\\nPool full of liquor, then you dive in it\\nI wave a few bottles, then I watch \\'em all flock\\nAll the girls wanna play Baywatch\\nI got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it\\nPo-pool full of liquor, I\\'ma dive in it\\n\\n[Refrain]\\nPour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)\\nSit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)\\nPass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)\\nFaded (Drank), faded (Drank)\\n\\n[Segue]\\nSherane\\nSherane (Pool full of— and we-and we dive in it, in-in it)\\nSherane, Sherane\\n(Wat-watch \\'em all flock) Aw, man\\n(Girls wanna play, play, play) Sherane\\nWhere is she takin\\' me? (I got)\\nWhere is she takin\\' me? (Po-pool full of liquor, I\\'ma dive in—)\\n\\n[Verse 3]\\nAll I—, all I—, all I—\\nAll I have in life is my new appetite for failure\\nAnd I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?\\nIf it do, then you\\'re like me, makin\\' excuse that your relief\\nIs in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf\\nAs the window open, I release everything that corrode inside of me\\nI see you jokin\\', why you laugh? Don\\'t you feel bad? I probably sleep\\nAnd never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up\\nIn God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough\\n\\n[Skit]\\nThey stomped the homie out over a bitch?\\nK-Dot, you good, blood?\\nNow we can drop— yeah, we can drop you back off\\nThat nigga\\'s straight, man, that nigga ain\\'t trippin\\'\\nWe gon\\' do the same ol\\' shit\\nI\\'ma pop a few shots, they gon\\' ru— they run opposite way\\nFall right in ****\\'s lap\\nAnd he gon\\' tear they ass up, simple as that\\nAnd I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon\\' pop that bitch too\\nWait hold up, ayy, I see somebody\\n*Car door opens and gunshots are fired*\\nAha, got them niggas\\nK-Dot, you good? ****, you good?\\nYeah, blood, I\\'m good, Dave, you good? Dave?\\nDave, say somethin\\'\\nDave?\\nThese bitch-ass niggas killed my brother'"
