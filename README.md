# Ghost-Writer-Detector

Drake, being one of the biggest rappers in the game, also comes with his fair share of critics and controversy. From his public beef with Kendrick Lamar in late 2024 to his diss tracks with Pusha T, revealing his undisclosed child in 2018, Drake is no stranger to the headlines. 

Ghostwriting has also been a popular critique against the Toronto-based rapper, with the most notable case popping up in 2015 with Quentin Miller. Or more recently, with the now iconic clip with Souja Boy in the Breakfast Podcast claiming Drake stole his "flow word for word, bar for bar!" in his first released song. 

For this project, I'll put my best investigative cap on using the power of NLP to test the validity of these claims. 

Specifically, I'll try implementing an artist speicifc embedding which will hopefully capture the artists style and flow. Using these vectors we can then see how similar two artists styles are for a given song. If fine tuned enough this with capture where the artist might have gotten insirpation from and even potentially if another artist was involved in the creative process but wasn't given full credit.
