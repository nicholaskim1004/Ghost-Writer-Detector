0,Mac Miller,Party on Fifth Ave.,"[Produced by ID Labs]

[Intro]
Yeah, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
I think—, I think I see where you're goin' with this one, E

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey
Been around the world and back, yeah, I did that
Still kick raps that cause impact, so where my kids at?
These mu'fuckers hatin', soundin' funnier than Sinbad
I'm ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse
This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?
We the assholes that she warned you about
We just storm in your house, open doors through a cloud
Got an assortment of style, just be sure that it's wild
6:30 in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down
Twin sisters gettin' wasted, so they both are down
It's goin' down, I thought I told you, man
If you tryna party, let me see you raise your hand

[Chorus]
There's a party on Fifth Ave. (Party on Fifth Ave.)
Hit me if you tryna go (Hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like twenty, I'ma honk it and come runnin'
'Cause we gotta hit the road (We gotta hit the road)
Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes (New shoes)
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose (You choose)
There's a party on Fifth Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do

[Verse 2]
Hey, what's the difference 'tween me and you?
When no one believe in you, I'm flyer than Beetlejuice
Don't count on the sheep to snooze, I'm fucked up off weed and booze
I party then sleep 'til noon, what every day people do
So haters see me improve, just give me a week or two
See when you read the news, my bitches all sleepin' nude
My rhyme talent is why my album is fly
Your favorite record, you gon' put it aside
This that old school shit, soundin' good in the ride
And fuck ten, I'm only countin' to nine
Said this that old school shit, soundin' good in the ride
So let's head out to the party, I'll drive

[Chorus]
There's a party on Fifth Ave. (Party on Fifth Ave.)
Hit me if you tryna go (Hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like twenty, I'ma honk it and come runnin'
'Cause we gotta hit the road (We gotta hit the road)
Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes (New shoes)
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose (You choose)
There's a party on Fifth Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do

[Bridge]
What's goin' on? There's a party
Hope the neighbors don't mind us gettin' loud
Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right
We came to get down, we gon' do that now
My light up shoes on, my light up shoes on, my light up shoes on
They love the way my kicks flash
This ain't a time to just sit back
'Cause there's a party on Fifth Ave

[Chorus]
There's a party on Fifth Ave. (Party on Fifth Ave.)
Hit me if you tryna go (Hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like twenty, I'ma honk it and come runnin'
'Cause we gotta hit the road (We gotta hit the road)
Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes (New shoes)
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose (You choose)
There's a party on Fifth Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do"
1,Mac Miller,Smile Back,"[Chorus]
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back

[Verse 1]
Tell them haters, call your army, bring your tanks
I'm a big boy with a big boy bank
Self-employed, independent, once you start, don't take no breaks
Work until I get it, I bet it's gon' take a second
But once I start up my engine, I'm gone, too fast to catch him
I'm Lennon mixed up with UGK, maybe try that purple drink
What I'm on is strong, yours weaker than seven days
You sweeter than crème brûlée, presidential head of state
Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade
Elevate, Buddha shit, cooler than what coolest is
Slick without no lubricant, bullshit, you just full of it
Stupid bitch, keep on hatin', I'ma keep on doin' it
Spend a day as me, boy, you couldn't get the shoes to fit

[Chorus]
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back

[Verse 2]
They used to tell me I was fake, they would hate, now they on my dick
Most Dope is my family, have respect for my conglomerate
Rollie on my wrist, I ain't rich, but I'm still coppin' shit
Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick
And bring it back
I could change the world with just a single track
Underage table in the back, smokin', drinkin' yak
Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at
On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball
After all, only get one life, so there's no time to stall
I'ma do it, stupid dudes with all exclusive shit to move with
Just a few kids tryna bullshit, still my boys I straight up grew with

[Chorus]
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back"
2,Drake,Middle of the Ocean,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
I'm in the Missoni room at the Byblos
The boat was rockin' too much on some Aaliyah shit
For real
We goin' from the Vava to Cinquante-Cinq, then back to the Vava
If you know, you know, baby, I don't, I don't know what to tell you
Yeah
Ayy

[Verse: Drake]
Look
Long way from Sette Mezzo
Meet Tommaso and Ernesto
Short rigatoni with the pesto
These verses are my manifesto
Hallways got an echo
Me and Smiggz on the loose in the city, you know how the rest go
Casual sex, I'm like, ""Fuck a dress code""
The first martini is an espresso
Chill shot glasses with prosecco
Niggas so ignorant in our hood, they bе like, ""Why the fuck you makin' techno?""
I'm worldwidе and this is just another cargo jet flow, I had to let go
Life insurance policies, you niggas 'bout to need the gecko
I got some meaner threats, though
Me, Spider-Man, and Leonardo, I'm back tomorrow
I had the chopper to a wedding out in Monaco or Monte Carlo
I'm losin' track of where we all go
I wouldn't trade my life for none of y'alls, it's an embargo
Fifty-nine bags on the 767, this is heavy cargo
Yeah
Fifty-nine bags on the—, ayy
Swedish jail cell smellin' like some Carby Musk
For your birthday, your boyfriend got a party bus
Bottle signs, club lines, should've come with us
We left that shit in '09 when we was comin' up
I mean, these just my suggestions of course
EmRata here fresh off divorce
And I'm tryna look in her eyes, maybe express my remorse
If she want a rebound with me, I'm down to go get her some boards
I'm here for the moral support
Whippin' the Vespa off of six tequilas
Big Benjamins like the Pittsburgh Steelers
Drake, you got it
Robert Kraft sent the jet for us, that shit was patriotic
You would think we live in Baltimore, the way they ravin' 'bout the latest product
Teachin' niggas how to mind they business, and my latest stuff
Might be the only teacher that gets paid enough
That's why I'm in Hyde Park buyin' like half of Harrods
You niggas are too concerned with makin' sure y'all outfits gon' match in Paris
If we don't like you, you payin' tax and tariffs
Come to the 6 and I'm like the actin' sheriff, deputy
First got to America, niggas wouldn't check for me
No chance the kid'll make it here like vasectomy
They underestimated my trajectory
But now they gotta pay that shit direct to me
I send the label bills, bills, bills like the other two women standing next to Bey, that shit was just—
Independent women is lovin' the new appearance
Matter of time before I go net a Bey like apiarist
Like, ""Honey, you gotta know that I never wore Mike Amiris or never hopped in a Urus""
I got my head in the clouds, I'm serious
The lyrics begin to reveal themselves over time periods
Promise you'll get that shit when the sky clears
This shit designed for divine ears
My favorite two words from you white boys is, ""Sign here""
And then comes the sound of glass clinkin' from a wine cheers
Swear I'm pocket checkin' y'all for five years
And then we 'bout to kick this shit in high gear
Eight karats like vegetarians, nigga, the earrings are droopy
Contract Lord of the Rings, think it's a script for the movie
Shout out TVGUCCI, my cousin is spooky
I swear you don't even mean what y'all say like y'all dubbin' a movie
Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie
He claim we don't got a problem but
No, boo, it is like you comin' for sushi
We might pop up on 'em at will like Suzuki
Kawasaki, sushi, saké, the money grow on trees like shiitake
They tried to get spicy with me, so I wonder how they gon' stop me
I'm really on a roll like hamachi
The fuck would y'all really do without me?
For your birthday, your man got a table at Hibachi
Last time I ate there, Wayne was doin' numbers off the cup like Yahtzee
And Paris Hilton was steady duckin' the paparazzi
Quavo might've sent me a song that he called ""Versace""
I really can't remember it properly
All I know is that God got me, I'm sittin' on large properties
Treat me like a newborn, Lucian not droppin' me
I'm goin' Pink Floyd, you niggas cannot rock with me
She could be givin' me head and somehow you not toppin' me
Niggas see the 6ix God pass, they high-fivin' me
Need to be high-sixin' me
Swear niggas highkey sick of me
They wifey on my head 'cause I vibe differently
Feel like an AMBER Alert the way that I can take her to the mall and she find Tiffany
I'm like a cup holder the way that these dimes stick to me
They should've been in the fountain based on what y'all wishin' me

[Outro: Birdman]
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah
Million-dollar spot (Brr, brr)
That's how motherfuckers in CMB play it
Middle of the ocean (Blatt)
Just like that (Shine, shine)
All dark fresh green water
Land that thing
With 'bout a hundred hoes
We up and we livin' like that, boy
Fresh fly fish like, you understand me, like, real G shit
You hear me? A neighborhood superstar
It's bigger than anything
You know, we start from the bottom, then we come to the top
Get to the top and we stay up there
You hear me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)
We look down and we'll be down, but we stayin' up
And we rise up, we stay on 'em, you heard me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)
Big Florida water, big water ocean
On that type of time
You understand me?
Rich nigga, rich life, you understand me?
Come from the bottom, but we come from the bottom (Rich life)
But we understand the bottom 'cause we come from it
And we live with it (You understand?)
Go to our grave 'bout this here, boy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)"
3,Drake,Rich Flex,"[Part I]

[Intro: 21 Savage & Young Nudy]
Go
 buy a zip of weed, hit the club
Pay for 'bout ten niggas to get in
We crunk, lit, in this bitch, yeah
Know we walk around the world
Steppin', not givin a damn 'bout where our feet land at, yeah
Get your ass mushed, smooshed (
6ix
)
Yeah, 21, the biggest
Put a nigga in the chicken wing, pussy

[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
21, can you do somethin' for me? (
21
)
Can you hit a lil' rich flex for me? (
21
)
And 21, can you do somethin' for me? (
21, 21
)
Drop some bars to my pussy ex for me
Then 21 (
21
), can you do somethin' for me? (
Yeah
)
Can you talk to the opps' necks for me? (
Okay
)
21, do your thing 21, do your thing (
21
)
Do your thing, 21, do your thing

[Verse: 21 Savage]
Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her panties off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period, baby, can you suck it?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty in Magic (21, 21)
I'll slap a pussy nigga with a ratchet (Pussy)
I might slap a tracker on his whip and get the addy (Pussy)
Don't call me on Christmas Eve, bitch, call your daddy (21)
Bitch, call your uncle (21), bitch, don't call me (21)
Always in my ear, your ho a flea (Fuck)
Why my opps be posting guns and only use they feet? (21)
Paid like an athlete, I got—

[Segue: Drake]
All you hoes, all of you hoes need to remember who y'all talkin' to
It's a Slaughter Gang CEO
I got dick for you if I'm not workin', girl
If I'm busy then fuck no
You need to find you someone else to call
When your bank account get low, you need to find you someone—

[Part II]

[Intro: Drake]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm on that Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit, ayy

[Verse: Drake]
Sticks and stones, chrome on chrome
That's just what a nigga on
Internet clones, got 'em kissin' through the phone
Pussies cliquin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy
Nan' nigga seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND
I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing B&E
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then it's BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin' every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P. to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late
21 my addy, so the knife is on the gate
All the dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate
Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie-ass mistake, ayy

[Outro: Drake & Young Nudy]
Ah, what? What?
Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
On God
Boy, look, you the motherfuckin' man, boy, you, ooh
You is the man, you hear me?"
4,Drake,Miss Me,"[Verse 1: Drake & Bun B]
I said, ""Tell me what's really goin' on""
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right?
 Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said ""If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em""
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Soo-woo if you bangin', motherfucker!

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Outro: Drake]
Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when I’m gone
Miss me a little when I’m gone, gone, gone
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah"
5,J. Cole,h u n g e r.on.h i l l s i d e,"[Intro: J. Cole]
Alright now, alright now
God has a plan for you
And all you've got to do is believe, believe, believe
Yeah

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Shit gon' get hard, keep your head strong
If I quit now, then I'm dead wrong
Fightin' off this hunger for hours
Big stepper, nigga, don't get stepped on
The money might fade, but respect don't
Still gon' be me when success gone
I don't speak the language of cowards
I walk through the flame like I'm Teflon

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
I sucked up the pain and I kept goin'
Whole world know my namе, bitch, my rep strong
We sold out in less than a hour
Thеse words I still sang like I'm slept on
I sin, so I can't cast the next stone
Unless it's baguettes 'round my neck bone
Inside of my frame lies a power
You can't get this game from no TED Talk
I wanna know if they understand me
I put it all on A, ain't no plan B
Hopin' all this weight ain't gon' drown me
Fucked around, got grey hairs already
Runnin' up the stairs on a tower
Runnin' up these Ms by the hour
If I drop a gem, money showers
When you get your taste, they get sour

[Chorus: J. Cole & Bas]
Shit gon' get hard, keep your head strong
Just keep your head strong
The money might fade, but respect don't
The ultimate price is regret now
Still gon' be me when success gone
Still gon' be me, ahh-ahh-ahh
Big stepper, nigga, don't get stepped on

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Waitin' my turn like grains of sand inside a hourglass
Mainly concerned back in the day with how long I would last
Make a few thousand dollars stack with every hour passed
I catch you playin' inside my lane and I'ma foul your ass
Put the whole game on top my back, don't need no chiropract'
They callin' me young PWC, I got my power back
Ain't fuckin' around, beefin' with me gon' get you hollered at
Niggas can't see me one-on-one, that's word to Kyla Pratt
You hittin' them weights, congratulations 'cause you built somethin'
You takin' a lot of boxin' lessons, but you still pussy
I see right through you niggas just like 2Pac hologram
Ain't doin' Coachella, bookin' me gon' be a lot of Ms
I'm feeling myself, I'm building my wealth up 'til it's towerin'
I put my tongue all in my bitch, she get to hollerin'
I ain't doin' no dirt no more, I stopped creepin' six years ago
Fun fuckin' them hoes until you realize that you is the ho

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Shit gon' get hard, keep your head strong
If I quit now then I'm dead wrong
Fightin' off this hunger for hours
Big stepper, nigga, don’t get stepped on
The money might fade, but respect don't
Still gon' be me when success gone
I don't speak the language of cowards
I walk through the flame like I'm Teflon

[Outro: Bas]
Can't be afraid of sunlight (Sunlight)
Spotlights when it glows (It glows)
All the pain you hold
Makes you worth your weight in gold
Can't be afraid of sunlight (Sunlight)
Spotlights when it glows (It glows)
All the pain you hold
Makes you worth your weight in gold
God has a plan for you
And all you've got to do is believe, believe, be—"
6,J. Cole,l e t.g o.m y.h a n d,"[Chorus: J. Cole]
Soldier's song, marching on, on
Hoping to see home
If I die before I
See your smile just one more time

[Verse: J. Cole]
Sometimes I question whether this shit matters
Puttin' substance into something in a world so used to instant gratification
I found this instrumental on my phone while on vacation
Ib sent it a year ago or so
I probably heard it before, but slept on it, you know?
Shit don't always connect as soon as you press play
At times you gotta step away, do some livin'
Let time provide a new prescription, givin' truer vision
I dibble-dabble in a few religions
My homie constantly telling me 'bout Quran, puttin' me on
I read a few pages and recognize the wisdom in it
But I ain't got the discipline for stickin' with it
Now I'm on the way to London, got a show for seven digits
I'm wonderin' just when did I become my biggest critic?
I wanna be my biggest fan, like how I was when didn't nobody know my jams
Today my son said, ""Dad, let go my hand""
Reminded me one day he's gonna be his own man
And my job is to make sure he's equipped
I gotta make sure he not no bitch 'cause niggas bound to try him
If I said I was the toughest growin' up, I would be lyin'
I had a fear of gettin' punched while everybody eyein'
Add to that a constant fear of dyin'
By gunshot wound, or other violent type of endings
I kept a tough demeanor on the surface but was mostly just pretendin'
Luckily my bluff was workin' way more often than not
But sometimes a nigga pulled my card, tryna expose me for a fraud
And with my reputation at stake
I was scufflin' just to save face
Couple wins, couple losses, some broken up too quick to call it
My last scrap was with Puff Daddy, who would've thought it?
I bought that nigga album in seventh grade and played it so much
You would've thought my favorite rapper was Puff
Back then I ain't know shit, now I know too much
Ignorance is bliss and innocence is just ignorance before it's introduced to currency and clips
Or bad licks that have a nigga servin' three to six, shit

[Chorus: J. Cole, Bas & 6LACK]
Soldier's song, marching on, on
Hoping to see home
If I die before I
See your smile just one more time

[Bridge: Bas]
Soldier's song
I could be one to lean on
Time will right the wrongs
Won't be long
How can we grow any closer?
How can we grow any closer?
How can we grow any closer?
How can we grow any closer?
Something inside of me's tryna crawl up to the surface
Something is suddenly smothering, stopping me
Stubbornly getting its way (Way), way (Way)
Drowning out the wave (Drowning out)
I've got a reason to believe that I'll turn out just fine
Soldier's song

[Outro: Diddy]
Lord, please guide our steps
Watch us, cover us
So that every move we make is in alignment with Your will
Your purpose
Please fill us with Your spirit
Keep us forever in the present
For presence makes the strongest fathers
Teach us how to lead
Show us how to love"
7,Kendrick Lamar,Squabble Up,"[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
God knows
I am reincarnated
I was stargazin'
Life goes on, I need all my babies (Gyah, gyah)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & 
Debbie Deb
]
Woke up lookin' for the broccoli
High-key, keep a horn on me, that Kamasi
IP, ownership, the blueprint is by me
Mr. Get Off, I get off and mop feet
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, now is your chance
A yee nigga couldn't try me in the tri-state
Buddy pass, bet I get him splashed 'til he hydrated
Bounce out, know he spook town, eyes dilated
I got the money and the power both gyratin'

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but shе don't got no taste
I walk in, walked out with the safе
Mando, let me know what the play

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What the fuck?
I got hits, I got bucks, I got new paper cuts
I got friends, I got foes, but they all sitting ducks
Hit his turf and get crackin', double back like a deluxe
Fifty deep, but it ain't deep enough
Fuck a plea, there he go, beat him up
Fallin' from a money tree and it grow throughout the months
Spit a loogie at the camera, speed off, yeah, it's us

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but she don't got no taste
I walk in, walked out with the safe
Mando, let me know what the play

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Squabble up, squabble up
Squabble up, squabble up
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up (Mm, mm)
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Hol' up (

Where you from? (
Where you from?

Bye, bitch (

I'm finna go dumb (
Finna go dumb

Sideways (

I'm on one (

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, baby rockin' it
Quid pro quo, what you want? 'Cause I'm watchin' it
Work on the floor, let me know if you clockin' it
Brodie won't go, but I know that he poppin' it
It was wolf tickets on sale 'til I silenced it
Pipe down, young, these some whole other politics
Bitch with him and some bitch in him, that's a lot of bitch
Don't hit him, he got kids with him, my apologies
Ghetto child, it was Blacky Milds with the Smirnoff
Yeehaw, we outside, whoadie 'bout to kill him off
Blaps on blaps, it's a fact, this a brick of raw
Tell me why the fuck you niggas rap if it's fictional?
Tell me why the fuck you niggas fed if you criminal?
""Ayy, Dot, can I get a drop?"" I'm like, ""Nigga, nah""
Ace boon coon from the Westside to Senegal
It's a full moon, let the wolves out, I been a dog (Ah)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but she don't got no taste
I walk in, walked out with the safe
Mando, let me know what the play

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Squabble up, squabble up
Squabble up, squabble up
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up (Mm, mm)
Squabble up (Mm, mm), squabble up"

If this world were mine

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hey, Roman numeral seven, bae, drop it like it's hot
If this world was mine, I'd take your dreams and make 'em multiply
If this world was mine, I'd take your enemies in front of God
Introduce 'em to that light, hit them strictly with that fire
Fah-fah, fah-fah-fah, fah-fah, fah
Hey, Roman numeral seven, bae, drop it like it's hot
If this world was mine, I'd take your dreams and make 'em multiply
If this world was mine, I'd take your enemies in front of God
Introduce 'em to that light, hit them strictly with that fire
It's a vibe, do your dance, let 'em watch
She a fan, he a flop, they just wanna kumbaya, nah

[Chorus: SZA, SZA & Kendrick Lamar]
In this world, concrete flowers grow
Heartache, she only doin' what she know
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure
If this world were—
If it was up to me
I wouldn't give these nobodies no sympathy
I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything
I just wanna see you win, wanna see

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & SZA]
I can't lie
I trust you, I love you, I won't waste your time

I'ma make you say it loud
I'm not even trippin', I won't stress you out
I might even settle down for you, I'ma show you I'm a pro
I'ma take my time and turn it off
Just so I can turn you on, baby
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure

[Outro: SZA]
I know you're comin' for
Better days
If this world were mine"
9,Kanye West,Selah,"[Verse 1: Kanye West]
God is King, we the soldiers
Ultrabeam out the solar
When I get to Heaven's gates
I ain’t gotta peek over
Keepin' perfect composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I’m just focused
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
Pour the lean out slower
God is clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judge
They did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted 
Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday
Won't be in bondage to any man
John 8:33
We the descendants of Abraham
Ye should be made free
John 8:36
To whom the Son set free is free indeed
He saved a wretch like me

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, He is wonderful

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Sunday Service Choir]
If you woke, then wake up
With Judas, kiss and make up
Even with the bitter cup
Forgave my brothers that drank up
Did everything but gave up
Stab my back, I can't front
Still, we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up (Hallelujah)
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth (
Hallelujah
)
Everything old shall now become new
The leaves’ll be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor, as written in Luke
The army of God and we are the truth"
10,Kanye West,I Thought About Killing You,"[Intro: Francis and the Lights & 
Kanye West
]
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it

[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(
Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm
)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(
Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm
)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

[Verse: Kanye West]
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say ""He died so young""
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay"
11,Jay-Z,Only A Customer,"[Intro: Jay-Z]
Ha ha, ha ha, Roc-A-Fella y'all
9-6, futuristic shit, bee-atch
Uh
What the fuck? How we do
How we do, uh-huh, uh-huh

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
It's the eventual triple platinum nigga with the solid gold fade
All that nickle and dime shit, don't hold no weight
Fortune 5, top 5 in the Forbes (You'll see)
As you thumb through The Source, I read the Robb Report
Class C, cold me down with the plastic
That's all I ask of you, like Raphael Saadiq
At the Hotel Nikko, Robert Duvall suite
My people's eyes through the peep hole
I'm loving you down freak, as I
Shoot through the city like a rumor
Not soon enough, to stop 'em from spreading
The newspaper heading read ""Jay-Z breathes, 80 degrees
Only thing to cool him off is a Malibu Bay Breeze""
Can't stop for the Feds, say cheese
You know they wanna take a nigga picture
Pray for the day to get ya but I'ma parlay, stay richer for now
Jigga haven't done dirt in a while
You know my stomach's getting weak from living life on these streets for real
Tryna oversee it from suites, ordering eats
At the top where the real criminal minds meet
That's where the cream is (Right?!)
That's where your dream is (Well ain't it?)

[Chorus: Jay-Z, LL Cool J & Mary J. Blige]
You're only a customer
When your walkin' in the presence (Uh-huh) of hustlers (Uh-huh, Spend money all night)
(All night long) (Bee-otch
Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha)
You're only a customer (Uh)
When your walkin' (Uh) in the presence (Uh) of hustlers (Uh, spend money all night)
(All night long)
(Roc-A-Fella)
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Irv Gotti]
Ayo my youth had a nigga too aggressive, I
I used to speed excessive, both eyes closed
No thought invested, hitting pot holes
Cop-o's'll snatch away what you deem most precious
Had to rethink things
Is pinky rings worth life on the run and time served in Sing Sing?
I don't know to tell the truth, if I'm pressed for dough
Gotta consult Irv Gotti y'all, (Heads got to roll)
I was raised to live, Lord I pray you forgive
If not, I just handle it like Jason Kidd
What you're facing is official (It's official)
Most cases when I'm blazing won't miss you (Won't miss you)
Case and point made bullshit a issue, I see it to the end
My writing so personal, my heart bleeding through the pen
Make no mistake about me
It's only one nigga living, I got half a cake about me
I got love, I can kill a friend over fam not drugs
And very, few people understand that love
To make a nigga die bleeding is nothing (Nothing)
You make a motherfucker die breathing then you saying something
Beeotch

[Chorus: Jay-Z, LL Cool J & Mary J. Blige]
You're only a customer
When (Uh) your walkin' (Uh) in the presence (Uh) of hustlers (Uh-huh, spend money all night)
(All night long) (Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha)
You're only a customer
When (Ah ha) your walkin' in the presence (Ah ha) of hustlers (Spend money all night)
(All night long) (Roc-A-Fella)
(Uh-huh)
You're only a customer (Yea)
When your walkin' (Huh) in the presence (Huh) of hustlers (Huh, spend money all night)
(All night long)
(Roc-A-Fella)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
More flavor than y'all can imagine having
Graphic like Sega Saturn
Traffic like the Bodega, just so happens
You caught me at the the tail end of my dirt
Brain ain't right from inhaling the work all my life, fuck it
Greasy I, had the whole D.C. high
Pissy off Cristals, 3G high
Caesar Bacardi, VVS's blesses my body
We be fresh at the party, play yourself go 'head
If you don't know the ledge, it's like spitting to God
Get it in the face, fucking with niggas over your head
Take your time with me, shifty
Used to make coke stretch like a sample in the 950
Shit with that, while I'm on a Kawasaki bike
At the light, doing a pike, with a bitch on the back
And take flight, my life like it was directed by Hype
In 35 slow-mo, with the Roc-A-Fella logo
Acapulco to Aruba, Bay Breezes and caviar beluga
Very little loot, eludes us
In the grayish blueish L-e-x coupe
It's the root of evil in these people, what the fuck?

[Chorus: Jay-Z, LL Cool J & Mary J. Blige]
You're only a customer
When you're walkin' in the presence of hustlers
(All night long) (Spend money all night)
(Roc-A-Fella, uh huh, uh huh, beeotch)
You're only a customer (Ah ha)
When you're walkin' in the presence (Ah ha) of hustlers (Spend money all night)
(All night long) (Roc-A-Fella, uh-huh, uh-huh)

12,Jay-Z,American Dreamin,"[Intro: Marvin Gaye]
Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn, and
I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all, that's all, baby

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & JAY-Z]
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
But there's always— that's all, that's all, baby (Uh, uh)

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Bimmers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Daydreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
Mama, forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas is starving
Nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of bagging snid-ow the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clid-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & JAY-Z]
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
I'm just American dreamin'
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
But there's always— that's all, that's all, baby (Uh, uh)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there
And it's not quite near, and it's not like we're
Professionals, moving the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah, got a connect? No
Who in the F knows how to be successful
Need a personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, it's all in the stars
It's like Tony La Russa on how you play your cards
'Cause y'all ain't fucking with me, the ironies are
At all costs, better avoid these bars
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Going in circles, it's a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up, Muttley, you're dreaming again
Your own reality show, the season begins

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & JAY-Z]
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
I'm just American dreamin'
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
But there's always— that's all, that's all, baby

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Step one in this process, scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince 'em that you're not from the precinct
Please speak slow 'cause he no speaky no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
Now in the game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well— hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming
And the cops is coming, you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine
The game as we know it, one dream at a time
I'm American dreamin'

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye & JAY-Z]
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
Oh no, I never gave up no way (I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
But there's always— that's all, that's all, baby

Jumpin' on a jet, I'm going far
Perc' 30 hit hard
Boy, don't play with my squad
I've been rich since sixteen, nigga, keep your day job
Yellow Lamborghini look like corn on the cob
This a new push to start
I'm in the 6 trapping hard
Shootouts in my front yard
Shooters pull up, blitz, we gon' hit, nigga, we want y'all
AR knock his head off
Slide, sled, Santa Claus
My chopper clap, round of applause
I got shooters all in Illinois
Hellcat, my engine roaring
Private jet, the big Boeing
Flew on the big Boeing
My wrist cost like six tons
Got my stick, got my glick gun
This a Lambo' Urus, all yellow Camaro, boy, go get one
This Draco is gon' hit somethin'
This bankroll like six somethin'
I'm posting in the trenches with young niggas that's gon' blitz somethin'
Started trapping at midnight, ended at like six-somethin'
This ain't no small Glock, boy, this a big gun
Blue hundred bomber gang, nigga, ain't no damn ones
Blood red Aston Martin inside like a tampon
Soowoop Billy ride through Bompton
I'm from Compton
Hundred shots out the AR-15, hold a whole hundun
Slide back that minivan, know shooter go dumb-dumb
I shake that pot like pom-poms
I came up from Zone 1
Big Draco blitz somethin' dot com
Simpson Westside, Zone 1
Slide that Lambo' through the slums
AR-15 totin', I shoot my Glock, it got a drum
Chopper beat your chest like King Kong
I can taste the lean on my tongue
I came from the slums
Broke-ass nigga, you a bum
Murder gang, Westside, you knowing where I'm from, from, from, from

[Chorus]
My car, in my car
Sticks in my car
Bricks in my car
I got rich 'bout this car
